\section{Method}

\subsection{Participants}
Adolescents and parents/caregivers were recruited from
a clinical trial of treatments for depression in adolescents
conducted by the principal investigator. Families were
contacted if they had provided consent to be contacted
about future research opportunities. Nine adolescents
(age range=13â€“16, mean age=15.11, \textit{SD}=1.05) participated in the focus groups.
\subsection{Materials and Procedure}
A total of six focus groups were conducted: two with adolescents, two with parents, and two with providers. Semi-structured interview guides for each group were designed
by the research team for this study and were guided by
relevant constructs from the literature on CDSS implementation in other fields. The primary domains of
interest were perspectives on (1) the acceptability and
appropriateness of the CDSS-YD, (2) determinants of use
of the CDSS-YD, and (3) potential impact on treatment
processes.
