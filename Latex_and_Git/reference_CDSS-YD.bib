	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: This study examined national trends in 12-month prevalence of major depressive episodes ({MDEs}) in adolescents and young adults overall and in different sociodemographic groups, as well as trends in depression treatment between 2005 and 2014.
{METHODS}: Data were drawn from the National Surveys on Drug Use and Health for 2005 to 2014, which are annual cross-sectional surveys of the {US} general population. Participants included 172 495 adolescents aged 12 to 17 and 178 755 adults aged 18 to 25. Time trends in 12-month prevalence of {MDEs} were examined overall and in different subgroups, as were time trends in the use of treatment services.
{RESULTS}: The 12-month prevalence of {MDEs} increased from 8.7\% in 2005 to 11.3\% in 2014 in adolescents and from 8.8\% to 9.6\% in young adults (both P {\textless} .001). The increase was larger and statistically significant only in the age range of 12 to 20 years. The trends remained significant after adjustment for substance use disorders and sociodemographic factors. Mental health care contacts overall did not change over time; however, the use of specialty mental health providers increased in adolescents and young adults, and the use of prescription medications and inpatient hospitalizations increased in adolescents.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The prevalence of depression in adolescents and young adults has increased in recent years. In the context of little change in mental health treatments, trends in prevalence translate into a growing number of young people with untreated depression. The findings call for renewed efforts to expand service capacity to best meet the mental health care needs of this age group.},

	abstract = {{CONTEXT}: Adolescent depression is highly prevalent and has substantial morbidity, including suicide attempts, school dropout, and substance abuse, but many depressed adolescents are untreated. The school-based health clinic offers the potential for accessible and efficient treatment, although it is unknown whether school-based clinicians can be trained to implement evidence-based psychotherapies for depression in routine care.
{OBJECTIVE}: To assess the effectiveness of interpersonal psychotherapy modified for depressed adolescents ({IPT}-A) compared with treatment as usual ({TAU}) in school-based mental health clinics.
{DESIGN}: A 16-week randomized clinical trial was conducted from April 1, 1999, through July 31, 2002.
{SETTING}: Five school-based mental health clinics in New York City, {NY}. Patients Sixty-three adolescents referred for a mental health intake visit who met eligibility criteria. Eligible patients had a mean Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score of 18.6 ({SD}, 5.5) and a mean Children's Global Assessment Scale score of 52.6 ({SD}, 5.5) and met {DSM}-{IV} criteria for major depressive disorder, dysthymia, depression disorder not otherwise specified, or adjustment disorder with depressed mood. Mean age was 15.1 years ({SD}, 1.9 years). The sample was predominantly female (n = 53 [84\%]), Hispanic (n = 45 [71\%]), and of low socioeconomic status. Intervention Patients were randomly assigned to receive {IPT}-A (n = 34) or {TAU} (n = 29) from school-based health clinic clinicians.
{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, Children's Global Assessment Scale, Clinical Global Impressions scale, and the Social Adjustment Scale-Self-Report.
{RESULTS}: Adolescents treated with {IPT}-A compared with {TAU} showed greater symptom reduction and improvement in overall functioning. Analysis of covariance showed that compared with the {TAU} group, the {IPT}-A group showed significantly fewer clinician-reported depression symptoms on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (P =.04), significantly better functioning on the Children's Global Assessment Scale (P =.04), significantly better overall social functioning on the Social Adjustment Scale-Self-Report (P =.01), significantly greater clinical improvement (P =.03), and significantly greater decrease in clinical severity (P =.03) on the Clinical Global Impressions scale.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Interpersonal psychotherapy delivered in school-based health clinics is an effective therapy for adolescent depression. This effort is a significant step toward closing the gap between treatment conducted in the laboratory and community clinic.},

	abstract = {{ContextInitial} treatment of major depressive disorder in adolescents may include
cognitive-behavioral therapy ({CBT}) or a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor
({SSRI}). However, little is known about their relative or combined effectiveness.{ObjectiveTo} evaluate the effectiveness of 4 treatments among adolescents with
major depressive disorder.Design, Setting, and {ParticipantsRandomized} controlled trial of a volunteer sample of 439 patients between
the ages of 12 to 17 years with a primary Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, diagnosis of
major depressive disorder. The trial was conducted at 13 {US} academic and community
clinics between spring 2000 and summer 2003.{InterventionsTwelve} weeks of (1) fluoxetine alone (10 to 40 mg/d), (2) {CBT} alone,
(3) {CBT} with fluoxetine (10 to 40 mg/d), or (4) placebo (equivalent to 10
to 40 mg/d). Placebo and fluoxetine alone were administered double-blind;
{CBT} alone and {CBT} with fluoxetine were administered unblinded.Main Outcome {MeasuresChildren}'s Depression Rating Scale-Revised total score and, for responder
analysis, a (dichotomized) Clinical Global Impressions improvement score.{ResultsCompared} with placebo, the combination of fluoxetine with {CBT} was statistically
significant (P = .001) on the Children's Depression
Rating Scale-Revised. Compared with fluoxetine alone (P = .02) and {CBT} alone (P = .01), treatment
of fluoxetine with {CBT} was superior. Fluoxetine alone is a superior treatment
to {CBT} alone (P = .01). Rates of response for fluoxetine
with {CBT} were 71.0\% (95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 62\%-80\%); fluoxetine alone,
60.6\% (95\% {CI}, 51\%-70\%); {CBT} alone, 43.2\% (95\% {CI}, 34\%-52\%); and placebo,
34.8\% (95\% {CI}, 26\%-44\%). On the Clinical Global Impressions improvement responder
analysis, the 2 fluoxetine-containing conditions were statistically superior
to {CBT} and to placebo. Clinically significant suicidal thinking, which was
present in 29\% of the sample at baseline, improved significantly in all 4
treatment groups. Fluoxetine with {CBT} showed the greatest reduction (P = .02). Seven (1.6\%) of 439 patients attempted suicide;
there were no completed suicides.{ConclusionThe} combination of fluoxetine with {CBT} offered the most favorable tradeoff
between benefit and risk for adolescents with major depressive disorder.},
